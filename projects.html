    <h1>Programming Projects</h1>
    <p>Here’s a collection of my coding projects—some academic, some personal, and all a little chaotic in their own way.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Raytracer:</strong> 
        <a href="https://github.com/robloxbus/Computer-Graphic-projects.git">Raytracer</a> – 
        A raytracing engine that parses NFF files to describe scenes and renders them with effects. Supports various object types through an enum structure including triangles, polygons, and spheres.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SSH-TCP:</strong> 
        <a href="https://github.com/robloxbus/TCP-client-server-simulations.git">TCP project</a> – 
        A simulation of TCP client-server communication demonstrating handshake, reliable delivery, and packet flow logic. Also uses SSH encryption.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>S-DES w/ Meet in the Middle Attack:</strong> 
        <a href="https://github.com/robloxbus/S-DES.git">S-DES</a> – 
        An implementation of Simplified DES along with a Meet-in-the-Middle cryptographic attack, showcasing key recovery techniques and cipher weaknesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>YouTube 'Likes' Server:</strong> 
        <a href="https://github.com/robloxbus/Like-Server.git">Likes Server</a> – 
        A C-based simulation that mimics a YouTube-like server using parent, primary, and likes processes (12 total). Processes communicate through sockets, log events, and validate incoming like data. Includes timeout handling and randomized like submissions via `sleep()` intervals.
